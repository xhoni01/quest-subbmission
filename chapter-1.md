Chapter 1 Day 1:

1.Explain what the Blockchain is in your own words. 

Blockchain is a distributed database, which stores the information digitally, and there is no main computer. Blockchain stores information in blocks an each block is 
dependend by the previous block. Blockchain is open to everyone and they can store data there, but once the data is stored it will be hard to be erased unless there is 
a function on the smart contract that allows you to undo changes. So basically the way that you change data and whether you can undo it or not is depended on the smart 
contract.

2.Explain what a Smart Contract is.

A smart contract is a program which is develped and deployed on the blockchain by the developers in order to determine what actions are allowed to be done on the
blockchain. They are responsible for every change of data that happens on the blockchain. They can be very efficient, safe and transparent when they are developed good,
but can also be malicious if not developed right.

3.Explain the difference between a script and a transaction.

A script is basically a piece of code which allows us to see data on blockchain, and it has no right to change data on blockchain, so it has some limited functions 
and it doesn't cost any money. Meanwhile a transaction is a part of smart contract a function defined there to be more specific which allows the user to change data
on the blockchain and costs money. It can also be used to harm users and steal their money in difference from scripts.
