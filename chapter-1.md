Chapter 1 Day 1:

1.Explain what the Blockchain is in your own words. 

Blockchain is a distributed database, which stores the information digitally, and there is no main computer. Blockchain stores information in blocks an each block is 
dependend by the previous block. Blockchain is open to everyone and they can store data there, but once the data is stored it will be hard to be erased unless there is 
a function on the smart contract that allows you to undo changes. So basically the way that you change data and whether you can undo it or not is depended on the smart 
contract.

2.Explain what a Smart Contract is.

A smart contract is a program which is develped and deployed on the blockchain by the developers in order to determine what actions are allowed to be done on the
blockchain. They are responsible for every change of data that happens on the blockchain. They can be very efficient, safe and transparent when they are developed good,
but can also be malicious if not developed right.

3.Explain the difference between a script and a transaction.

A script is basically a piece of code which allows us to see data on blockchain, and it has no right to change data on blockchain, so it has some limited functions 
and it doesn't cost any money. Meanwhile a transaction is a part of smart contract a function defined there to be more specific which allows the user to change data
on the blockchain and costs money. It can also be used to harm users and steal their money in difference from scripts. 

Chapter 1 Day 2:

1.What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?

  -Safety and security;
  -Clarity;
  -Approachability;
  -Developer Experience;
  -Resource Oriented Programming;
  
2. In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful?

Since still there are no clear legislation about blockchain and web 3 it is important for the programming language that is used to change data on blockchain to be secure and to offer safety to the user in order to build trust with the user. This also is related with clarity because more clean the code is, the more understandable, it will be easier to know what that code is doing and it will make it very easy for the user to distinguish between good written code and malicious code. Since there are not many resources to learn cadence it is important to be be like other programming languages so it will be easier for devlopers to learn and to create learning resources for it, also it must give the developers a clear explanation of the mistake and ways for error handling in order for the debug process to be easy and not tidious. Since we are working on blockchain it is very important to define a way of how we are going to in blockchain it is very important to define how to interact with those resources in blockchain and to keep them independent from each other.
